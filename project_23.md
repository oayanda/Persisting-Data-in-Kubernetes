# Persisting Data in Kubernetes

## Configure awsElasticBlockStore for Persisant Storage

An awsElasticBlockStore volume mounts an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EBS volume into your pod. The contents of an EBS volume are persisted and the volume is only unmmounted when the pod crashes, or terminates. This means that an EBS volume can be pre-populated with data, and that data can be shared between pods.
